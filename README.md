# BarTrackApp

The following is a prototype for an app created by Isabel Stoddart, Cara Nielson, and Krishti Bhowmick for an iOS programming class at The University of Texas at Austin.

The app allows users to rate bars in Austin on multiple criteria including Popularity, Crowdedness, Strictness, Current Wait Time, and Average Wait Time. The app uses Firebase to update wait times and ratings in real time as users add new data.

The storyboarding and coding was done completely in Xcode. Below is a screenshot of the main storyboard.
