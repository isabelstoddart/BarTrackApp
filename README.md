# BarTrackApp
## This is an app created by Isabel Stoddart, Cara Nielson, and Krishti Bhowmick for an iOS undergrad class at UT Austin.
### Description 
The following is a prototype for an app created for an iOS programming class at The University of Texas at Austin. I created this app in collaboration with two other classmates.

The app allows users to rate bars in Austin on multiple criteria including Popularity, Crowdedness, Strictness, Current Wait Time, and Average Wait Time. The app uses Firebase to update wait times and ratings in real time as users add new data. 



### How to Run
This app was created using Xcode.

To run, click on Clone, then run in Xcode, and the code will run right on Xcode!
